Manus - your personal robotics laboratory
=========================================

Manus is a manipulation robotics framework for educational purposes. It was written as a support software for a course on robotics and computer vision. 
This repository contains core components shared among different configurations of the system.

The project is still work-in-progress and is evolving (slowly). Please report bugs or feature requests to show interest in the project.
